--[=[
	@method connect
	@within signal
	
	Connects a function to the signal. This will be called whenever the signal is fired.
	Connections can be "disconnected" (they won't be called when the signal is fired) by calling the function that they return.
	```lua
	local sig = signal()
	
	-- You can connect a function like this
	sig:connect(function(text)
		print(text)
	end)
	
	-- You can also directly connect the function like this.
	sig:connect(print)
	
	-- Will print twice, because two connections.
	sig:fire("Hello, world!")
	```
	
	You shouldn't connect the same function twice. This is because the function is used as a reference to disconnect when disconnecting later.
	While it *might* work for simple or specialized cases, you may find that it doesn't work as expected in some cases.
	
	Connections will be ran in order of connection.
	
	It's also worth noting that disconnecting is not an optimal operation, as it will shift the array. If you have a lot of connections to a single signal, you should avoid frequent disconnections.

--[=[
	@method fire

	Firing a signal will run all connections in order, while using thread reusage.
	[You can find more on this optimization here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/thread-reuse-how-it-works-why-it-works/1999166).
	
	You should note these things about thread reusage:
	- You cannot rely on the thread being different, or the same consistently.
	- The above means that certain "no-yield" implementations might not work correctly in connections.
	- If you have a lot of connections, you should avoid yielding in said connections. Yielding forces a new thread to be spawned, which isn't optimal, but it's still okay.

--[=[
	@method delete
	@within signal
	
	Disconnects all connections to the signal, and renders the signal unusable.

	This will prevent and raise an error upon any attempts to use the signal, which is useful for debugging & catching leaks.
